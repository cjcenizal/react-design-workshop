# React Design Workshop

> A workshop on the process of designing React components and applications.

End-goal is to be comfortable writing React and contributing to Kibana. Work on it within your own domain.
Get ahead to a part where people can try writing some code on their own.

In this workshop, we'll learn about the process for implementing a design and functional requirements
in a React app. We'll learn by doing! Our challenge is to build a to-do list application and
implement requirements which gradually increase in complexity.

## Getting started

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
